# CardGuard: Advanced Credit Card Fraud Detection System

CardGuard is a sophisticated machine learning system designed to detect and prevent credit card fraud efficiently. Utilizing advanced data preprocessing and machine learning algorithms, CardGuard aims to protect users from unauthorized transactions by identifying fraudulent activities in vast datasets swiftly.

## Features

- **Efficient Data Processing**: Capable of handling and analyzing large volumes of transaction data to detect fraud in real-time.
- **Imbalanced Data Handling**: Employs various techniques to manage imbalanced datasets, ensuring accurate detection of fraudulent transactions.
- **Privacy-Oriented**: Implements dimensionality reduction and other data anonymization techniques to protect user privacy.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously adapts to new fraudulent patterns using state-of-the-art machine learning models, ensuring long-term resilience.
- **Comprehensive Model Evaluation**: Uses a variety of metrics to evaluate model performance, focusing on precision, recall, and F1-Score to balance the detection accuracy and false positives.
